Llama OCR
Llama OCR is a web-based tool built with Streamlit, leveraging Groq's Llama 3.2 Vision model for advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The tool extracts structured text from images and displays the content in a clear, readable markdown format.

Designed for simplicity and efficiency, Llama OCR is perfect for transforming any image with readable text into well-organized output for further use or analysis.

Features
Image Upload: Upload images in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format.
Text Extraction: Automatically extracts and formats the readable text in structured markdown.
Clear Results: Reset the app to upload a new image or start fresh.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for a smooth, interactive user experience.
Installation
Follow the instructions below to set up Llama OCR on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository
Begin by cloning the repository to your local system:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llama-ocr.git
cd llama-ocr
2. Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using the following command:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up Environment Variables
You need to configure your Groq API key to use the text extraction functionality.

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

makefile

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
5. Run the Application
Once everything is set up, you can run the Streamlit app:

bash

streamlit run app.py
This will start a local server and open the application in your default web browser.

Usage
Upload an Image
Navigate to the Upload Image section in the sidebar.
Click "Choose an image..." and select an image file from your local system. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, and JPEG.
Extract Text
Once the image is uploaded, click the "Extract Text üîç" button.
The app will process the image and extract the readable text using Groq's Llama 3.2 Vision model.
View Extracted Text
After the processing is complete, the extracted text will be displayed in a structured format in the main content area.
The text will be organized using Markdown formatting (headings, lists, etc.) for readability.
Clear Results
If you wish to reset the app and upload a new image, click the "Clear üóëÔ∏è" button.
This will delete the current results and allow for a fresh start.
Example Output
Once the image is processed, the extracted text might look something like this:
